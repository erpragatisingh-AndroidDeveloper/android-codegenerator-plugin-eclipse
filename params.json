{"name":"Android-codegenerator-plugin-eclipse","tagline":"Eclipse Plugin for Android code generation.","body":"### Introduction\r\nAndroid Code Generator Plugin for Eclipse was created to accelerate the process of creating or developing Android applications. Every Activity needs to have XML layout, and Activity contains all the wiring up code like: \r\n- fields for all required Views\r\n- assigning fields to actual objects (**findViewById()** method)\r\n- wiring up listeners to buttons (**setOnClickListener()** method)\r\netc...\r\n\r\nInstead of writing this code, I would be great if this code could be generated automatically. \r\nThis way I come up with idea to have a plugin which does the code generation. I couldn't find such plugin so I decided to write it by myself. Luckily I was off project then, and I could spend some time on it. \r\nThis way I created the first version in 2011. In 2014 I decided to basically rewrite the plugin from the beginning, add tests and split it into two projects: \r\n- library (https://github.com/tmorcinek/android-codegenerator-library)\r\n- main project - this one, which contains reference to library project, and all Plugin Development Environment related code.\r\n\r\n### Download\r\nAll versions of the plugin will be generated in **github** repo under:\r\nhttps://github.com/tmorcinek/android-codegenerator-plugin-eclipse/tree/master/plugins\r\n\r\n### Install\r\nCopy downloaded **jar** file to path **eclipse/plugins** directory.\r\n\r\n### How does it work\r\nPlugin is retrieving from xml files, data about all the views that contain **android:id** attribute. It collects informations about view's type and id. Based on the *type of object* and *id* plugin generates fields, assignment, imports and methods. For more informations go to [android-codegenerator-library](https://github.com/tmorcinek/android-codegenerator-library) project.\r\n\r\n### How to use it\r\n#### Creating Code from **layout** file \r\nIn Package Explorer click on layout file, and you will see the **Generate Android Code** menu:\r\n![Package Explorer Layout](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/86831510/eclipse-plugin/Screen%20Shot%202014-09-22%20at%2022.44.02.png)\r\nAfter clicking on one of the options Dialog will pop up: \r\n![Activity Dialog](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/86831510/eclipse-plugin/Screen%20Shot%202014-09-22%20at%2022.46.42.png)\r\nIf user click **Create File**, then file will be created and Text Editor with created file will automatically pop up.\r\n![Activity Editor](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/86831510/eclipse-plugin/Screen%20Shot%202014-09-22%20at%2022.48.58.png)\r\n\r\n#### Creating Code from **menu** file \r\nIn Package Explorer click on menu file: \r\n![Package Explorer Menu](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/86831510/eclipse-plugin/Screen%20Shot%202014-09-22%20at%2022.50.27.png)\r\nAfter click on **Menu** option Dialog will pop up: \r\n![Menu Dialog](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/86831510/eclipse-plugin/Screen%20Shot%202014-09-22%20at%2022.50.44.png)\r\n\r\n#### Templates changing in Preferences\r\nUser go to Eclipse preferences: \r\n![Eclipse Preferences](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/86831510/eclipse-plugin/Screen%20Shot%202014-09-22%20at%2023.13.19.png) \r\nThere is a hierarchy of pages under **Android Code Generator**: \r\n![Preferences Hierarchy](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/86831510/eclipse-plugin/Screen%20Shot%202014-09-22%20at%2022.49.38.png)\r\nUnder each tab there is Editable template:\r\n![Activity Template](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/86831510/eclipse-plugin/Screen%20Shot%202014-09-22%20at%2022.49.38.png)\r\n\r\n### Features\r\nThere are several very useful features some of them are:\r\n* generating Activity Class code from layout\r\n* generating Fragment Class code from layout\r\n* generating Adapter Class code from item layout\r\n* generating Menu code from menu xml\r\n* creating files from code\r\n* preview screen with generated code that can be modified before creation of file\r\n* detection of project package\r\n* preference page with editable templates for generated code, template for each: Activity, Fragment, Adapter, Menu\r\n\r\n### Plans for future\r\nThe plan is to create plugin for IntelliJ IDEA/Android Studio, since more and more people are using it (including the author of the plugin :).\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nThe author of both android-codegenerator-library (https://github.com/tmorcinek/android-codegenerator-library) and plugin (https://github.com/tmorcinek/android-codegenerator-plugin-eclipse) is Tomasz Morcinek @tmorcinek.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nIf you have any problems with the plugin, or want to help, please contact me: tomasz.morcinek@gmail.com and I will try to reply as soon as I can.
